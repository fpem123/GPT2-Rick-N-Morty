This project generates Rick and Morty script using GPT-2 model.

Model: https://huggingface.co/e-tony/gpt2-rnm

    How to use:
      * First, Choose Rick and Morty character name.
      * Second, Fill what the character will say in text. This will be base of script.
      * And then, Fill number in length. Text is created as long as "length". I recommend between 100 and 300.
      * If length is so big, generate time will be long.

### Post parameter
    
    name: The Rick and Morty character name.
    text: The base of script.
    length: The size of generated text. (min: 50)

### Output foramt

    {"0": [[character name, dialog], [character name, dialog], ...]}
